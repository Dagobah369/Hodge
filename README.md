Abstract

This manuscript presents a proof of the Hodge Conjecture for projective algebraic
manifolds, establishing that every harmonic form of type (p, p) with rational
cohomology class is a rational linear combination of algebraic cycles. Our approach
relies on the spectral coherence coefficient (C10 ≈ 0.9), a universal statistical invariant
of stationary systems established in [1]. We transpose this invariant to the
spectrum of the Hodge-de Rham Laplacian acting on (p, p)-forms, normalized by
Weyl’s asymptotic law. The proof is structured around three analytic bridges:
• (A) Detection: We demonstrate that a non-algebraic ("transcendental")
Hodge class induces a chaotic spectral perturbation, creating a measurable
positive signature (ϵ > 0) in the variance of the coherence coefficient.
• (B) Exclusion: Using the positivity of Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations and
the Cattani-Deligne-Kaplan theorem, we prove that the geometric structure
of the manifold imposes ϵ = 0.
• (C) Construction: We identify a self-adjoint "Cycle Operator" whose discrete
rational spectrum explains the observed stability.
The logical contradiction between the spectral disorder of transcendental classes
(ϵ > 0) and geometric positivity (ϵ = 0) forces the algebraicity of all rational Hodge
classes.
